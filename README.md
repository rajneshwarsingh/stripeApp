<p> Welcome to the Stripe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(solution_stack)"> MEAN Stack </a> Project</p>

<p>The MEAN stack is intended to provide a simple fullstack javascript applications.</p>
<p>MEAN is a set of Open Source components that together, provide an end-to-end framework for building dynamic web
    applications; starting from the top (code running in the browser) to the bottom (database). The stack is made up of:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        MongoDB: Document database – used by your back-end application to store its data as JSON (JavaScript Object
        Notation) documents</li>
    <li>Express (sometimes referred to as Express.js): Back-end web application framework running on top of Node.js</li>
    <li>Angular (formerly Angular.js): Front-end web app framework, runs your JavaScript code in the user's browser,
        allowing your application UI to be dynamic</li>
    <li>Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment – lets you implement your application back-end in JavaScript</li>
</ul>
